# ![vkmod_smol](./src/main/resources/assets/vulkanmod/vlogo_smol.png) VulkanMod Frequently Asked Questions

Greetings everyone !
This page was made to help you out with the most asked questions in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FVXg7AYR2Q). Please read those before asking for support, the answer to your question might already be here!

## Q: What is VulkanMod?
A: You can think of VulkanMod as a voxel rendering engine built with Vulkan, which replaces Minecraft's OpenGL engine to improve performance. Therefore it's not a just a direct port of vanilla OpenGL engine.

Do note that Vulkanmod doesn't act like [Zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html). "Porting minecraft java to Vulkan" as is doens't make much sense.

## Q: What do I need to run this mod?
A: You will need a GPU with at least Vulkan 1.2 support to run this mod. To check if your GPU support Vulkan please run `vulkaninfo` in a terminal (Linux & macOS) or run the [vulkan-test](https://github.com/skeeto/vulkan-test/releases/tag/1.0.2) program on Windows.

## Q: How can I fix "Vulkan Loader not found"?
A: The message means that your GPU doesn't support Vulkan. Make sure that your GPU drivers are up-to-date and that your GPU model actually supports Vulkan. If that's not the case you will need to use another GPU.

## Q: Does this mod support shaders?
A: Not yet, We are working on them but there's still a long way to go. No ETAs for now, some captures are available on the discord.

## Q: What about Linux and macOS?
A: You shouldn't encounter any issues with using VulkanMod on Linux. Native Wayland support has been added in 0.3.6, ensure you are running the lastest update. If you meet any issues on Linux or macOS, please let us know in [the issue tab](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/issues).

## Q: What launcher do I need?
A: Most launchers are fine, but we would generaly recommend using a legit launcher instead of cheat, pirate or modded clients. Though we do support third party clients if proper logs are provided, we can't fix launcher issues.

## Q: What about mod compatibility?
A: Check the [compatible mods thread](https://discord.com/channels/963180553547419670/1210918960082452500) on Discord.
